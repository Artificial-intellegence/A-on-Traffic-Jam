How does your better heuristic improve on blocking (while maintaining
admissibility)?

Our better heuristic also factors in whether cars blocking the route of car0
are also blocked themselves - therefore it will be higher than the blocking
heuristic on some occasions. If cars blocking car0 are blocked themselves, then
this will require additional moves in order to clear the path for car0.
There is no getting around these moves - they must be done, therefore our better
heuristic will still never overestimate the actual number of moves needed, thus
guaranteeing admissibility.

If you implemented the bonus heuristic, how does it improve on
Manhattan (while maintaining admissibility)?
